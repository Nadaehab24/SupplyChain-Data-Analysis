# SupplyChain-Data-Analysis
A project to clean, analyze, and forecast supply chain data, providing insights for decision makers using SQL, Python, and Tableau.

--- 

## 1. Introduction  
This project focuses on analyzing a Supply Chain dataset in order to extract valuable insights that can improve decision-making within logistics, procurement, and retail operations. The project involves four phases: data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, forecasting, and dashboard visualization.  

The primary goal is to evaluate product sales, supplier performance, shipping efficiency, and customer behavior to support strategic business decisions.

## 2. Dataset Description  
The dataset contains **100 rows (records) and 24 columns (features)**.  
It covers different aspects of the supply chain lifecycle: product information, customer demographics, inventory levels, supplier reliability, logistics costs, and quality control.  

### Key Features:  
- **Product Data**: Product type, SKU, Price, Availability, Number of products sold, Revenue generated.  
- **Customer Data**: Customer demographics.  
- **Inventory & Supply**: Stock levels, Lead times, Order quantities.  
- **Suppliers**: Supplier name, Location, Production volumes, Manufacturing costs, Defect rates.  
- **Logistics**: Shipping times, Carriers, Transport modes, Routes, Shipping costs.  
- **Quality Control**: Inspection results (Pass / Fail / Pending).  

The dataset contains some missing values, which require cleaning and preprocessing before analysis.

## 3. Methodology  

### Data Model, Cleaning, and Preprocessing  
- Build a structured data model.  
- Handle missing values and duplicates.  
- Normalize and format dataset for analysis.  
- **Deliverables**: Clean dataset + preprocessing notebook.  

### Analysis Questions Phase  
- Identify key business questions (e.g., *What is the impact of product category on revenue?*).  
- Perform exploratory data analysis using SQL and Python.  
- **Deliverables**: Set of analysis questions.  

### Forecasting Questions Phase  
- Apply predictive modeling to forecast demand, costs, and revenue.  
- Use time-series and regression analysis with scikit-learn.  
- **Deliverables**: Visual plots with forecasting results.  

### Visualization & Final Presentation  
- Build an interactive dashboard using Tableau.  
- Summarize findings in a final presentation.  
- **Deliverables**: Dashboard + final report.
